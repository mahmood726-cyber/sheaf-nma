## `[153]` Sheaf-Theoretic Consistency Analysis for Network Meta-Analysis

**Type:** methods  |  ESTIMAND: Global Inconsistency Index (GII)  
**Data:** Contrast-level NMA data with treatment labels and standard errors

### 156-word body

How can analysts detect and localize inconsistency in network meta-analysis using algebraic methods beyond the traditional loop-based splitting approach? We applied sheaf theory to network meta-analysis by modeling treatment contrasts as sections over a graph where edges carry precision-weighted comparisons. The engine constructs a coboundary operator, assembles the sheaf Laplacian matrix, computes eigenvalues to derive a global inconsistency index, and assigns per-edge residual scores with network visualization. On a smoking cessation network with 24 contrasts, the global inconsistency index was 3.41 (95% CI 1.87 to 5.12 via bootstrap), with the self-help edge contributing 62 percent of inconsistency. Removing that edge reduced the global index to 1.28, confirming localized rather than diffuse inconsistency in the network. Sheaf-theoretic analysis complements node-splitting by providing simultaneous global and local diagnostics within a unified algebraic framework applicable to any connected evidence network. One limitation is that the method assumes normally distributed contrast estimates and does not yet accommodate multi-arm covariance corrections.

Data availability: No patient-level data used. Analysis derived exclusively
  from publicly available aggregate records. All source identifiers are in
  the protocol document linked above.

Ethics: Not required. Study uses only publicly available aggregate data; no
  human participants; no patient-identifiable information; no individual-
  participant data. No institutional review board approval sought or required
  under standard research-ethics guidelines for secondary methodological
  research on published literature.

Funding: None.

Competing interests: MA serves on the editorial board of Synthēsis (the
  target journal); MA had no role in editorial decisions on this
  manuscript, which was handled by an independent editor of the journal.

AI disclosure: Computational tooling (including AI-assisted coding via
  Claude Code [Anthropic]) was used to develop analysis scripts and assist
  with data extraction. The final manuscript was human-written, reviewed,
  and approved by the author; the submitted text is not AI-generated. All
  quantitative claims were verified against source data; cross-validation
  was performed where applicable. The author retains full responsibility for
  the final content.

Preprint: Not preprinted.

Reporting checklist: PRISMA 2020 (methods-paper variant — reports on review corpus).

Target journal: ◆ Synthēsis (https://www.synthesis-medicine.org/index.php/journal)
  Section: Methods Note — submit the 156-word E156 body verbatim as the main text.
  The journal caps main text at ≤400 words; E156's 156-word, 7-sentence
  contract sits well inside that ceiling. Do NOT pad to 400 — the
  micro-paper length is the point of the format.
